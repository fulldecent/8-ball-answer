The Apple Watch icon has been updated. This is no longer black but is now a dark color. The background shows up as a circle as required on Apple Watch.

The app notes have been updated to say this is SPECIFICALLY designed for Apple Watch. This app is just the right amount of content for an Apple Watch app, but obviously light for an iOS app. The rules are still being written here and I believe the updated app description is helpful for users to know what they are getting. Since Watch apps require iOS apps, I hope you will be merciful with me on this point. This is not a fart app or a flashlight. This is a legitimate app which is perfectly suited for the Apple Watch. Please contrast this to the "Magic 8 Ball" app which added "utility" to a simple concept and wound up with a product that sucks but has passed App Store review.
